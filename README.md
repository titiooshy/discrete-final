# Financial & Safety Applications 

This is the coding repository for the Discrete Math Final Fall 2025, for the Project Gorup of Group Theory & Its Applications by Alexandra Greenberg, Titilayo Oshinowo, Troy Anderson, Suraj Reddy. 

### Purpose of This Code 
This code is the short application of the Verhoeff Check Digit Algorithm being used to check of both numbers given to the code and user inputted numbers to verfiy if the bank note is valid or not. 

### Code Files 
verhoeff_algorithm.py- Contains code for the algorithm where it checks if given numbers are valid of not in the code 
bank-note.py- Contains code that checks if user inputtedd a valid or invalid bank note number. It has ui to validate a bank note number and one that generates a check digit given a banknote, user must choose 1 or 2. For either option choosen the user must write out numbers and the system will print the answer.
